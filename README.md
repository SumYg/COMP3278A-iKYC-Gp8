When the user click start, the browser will start to create a peer connection with the server, then create a data channel and access the camera. The data channel will send the name of the user immediately after the channel is created, and the video track of the camera will be sent to the server through a track.

The name of the user arrive after the initialization of the `local_video`, which is a object of the class of `VideoTransformTrack`. If the user name has not been set, the server will turn the received frame to gray and return to the browser, otherwise it will return the original received frame to the browser. The frame returned from the server will be shown under `Media`.

After the user name is got by the server, a folder with the name of the user will be created inside the folder `data`.

And the server will save the frame into files.
